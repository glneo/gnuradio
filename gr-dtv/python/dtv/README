Decoding ATSC using 6.4MSps rate
---------------------------------

1) Verify signal, adjust antenna, and find the best gain setting using
uhd_fft.py. You can find station frequencies from the fcc video database.

2) Capture data - adjust gain (-g) frequency (-f) and which side
the daughterboard is on to fit your local setup, for example:

uhd_rx_cfile.py -s --samp-rate=6.4e6 -g 65 -f 503e6 atsc_data_6-4m_complex

You probably still need fast disks to record the data, like a raid-0 set of
striped sata drives or a SSD. Make sure there are no or very few Ou overruns.
Saving the raw usrp data in 'short' form halves the disk space/bus bandwidth
that the usual complex form uses.

3) Run atsc_rx.py:

./atsc_rx.py atsc_data_6-4m_complex outfile.ts

after this the file 'outfile.ts' will contain the MPEG2-TS video sutable for
playing on your player of choice, note that some handle errors in the stream
better than others.
